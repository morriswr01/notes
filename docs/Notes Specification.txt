Piano Drills App:

Name: Notes || PiaNotes || Pianotes
Description: App that allows creation of short passages of music which can be practiced.

Criteria:
- User Story - My music teacher has given me a passage of music or short exercise to practice. I want to be able to record this in the App and have it be presented when I next open the app such that I can use it to warm up.
- User Story - I want a random selection of warmup exercises selected from the list of exercises that I have added.
- User Story - I should be able to register an account such that my created notes can be stored against my account and pulled into the app when I log in.

Technical Criteria:
- Mobile first design but should also work just as well in a Desktop Browser
- Make use of AWS for backend, AWS Cognito for Auth(or Auth0)
- Front end should use a JS framework such as React or Vue
- Back end should use NodeJs but may be rewritten in Go at a later date
- Need some front end library for allowing input of musical notes on a stave
- Need some way of storing this musical note passage in persisted storage.

Wish list:
- Federated Login/Registration with Google

Libraries of use:
- https://github.com/AaronDavidNewman/Smoosic
- https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow

Todo:
- Investigate front end libraries, have a play around and find out which ones do what we are after.
- Front end wireframes
- Design a backend that manages auth, registration and notational storage

Docs to write:

- Design diagram
- Wireframes
- User stories
